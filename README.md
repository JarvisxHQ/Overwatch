# Overwatch
AI that keeps track and provides insightful information on your investments </br>

Currently, we are creating a desktop application with an AI backed with ML and other cool features to assist the user in helping them manage their investments. Overwatch is being build using Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</br>

## Getting Started
Since the project is in it's infancy, we haven't packaged the app yet but you can still use the product. To use our product, you need to install eel and run the Engine.py </br>

To install Eel:
```
pip install eel
```
